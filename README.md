Task 2 provided by Prodigy InfoTech is Completed.

The task was to built a simple to do list

I upgraded it one level by connecting it to react native async storage.

Tips : 

- Only use Async Storage if you want to store single values
- Do not use if you  want to store a list of objects or multiple values in a single variable
